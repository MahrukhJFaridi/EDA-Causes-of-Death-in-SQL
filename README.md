# EDA-Causes-of-Death-in-SQL


In my SQL EDA project, I conduct an in-depth analysis of global mortality, leveraging SQL aggregate functions and JOINs to unearth compelling insights. Beginning by identifying countries with the highest death rates attributed to specific diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases in the United States and road accidents in China, I unravel the stark realities shaping mortality patterns worldwide.

Utilizing temporary tables and Common Table Expressions (CTEs), I meticulously quantify the escalating risk of succumbing to heart disease in the US from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, I dissect the causes of death across various age demographics, revealing intriguing statistics â€“ from the elderly contributing 20% of heart disease-related deaths to adults comprising 60% of fatalities resulting from road accidents.

To streamline future analyses and visualization endeavors, I craft SQL Views to store curated datasets for seamless integration with visualization tools like Tableau.
